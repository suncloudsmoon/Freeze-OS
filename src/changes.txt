string_equalsignorecase / string_comparetoignorecase
 - tolower actually takes single characters as input; not strings.
 - normally I would use strcasecmp, but that is not standard and you appear to be using Windows.  I just added a caseless strcmp as a helper function is stringobj.c

getsa
 - use string_concat_c instead of string_concat. getchar returns a single char.  The address of that pointer is a type char*, but it should not be assumed NULL terminated.  string_concat uses strlen which assumes your char* is NULL terminated.

string_concat and string_concat_c
 - both + 1 on realloc check
 - realloc actually takes a *new* size as an argument, not an additional size.  So all you want to do is add to allocatedlength, and pass that to realloc.
 - commented memset in string_concat

string_init
 - initialize length and set the first char to '\0'

string_substring
 - NULL terminate tempString

interpreter.c:56
 - sizeof(ReadStatus*) -> sizeof(ReadStatus)

main
 - I added argc and argv so if you call your program with an argument it will read the argument file instead of hello world
